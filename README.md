# CALL-CENTER-CUSTOMER-SERVICE-DASHBOARD
This repository contains the Power BI dashboard for analyzing and visualizing call center performance metrics. The dashboard provides insights into call volume, duration, customer satisfaction, response times, and more.

Using EXCEL ðŸ“ˆand POWER BI, I was able to create a comprehensive tool to analyze and visualize call center performance. This dashboard provides actionable insights to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction. 

Data preparation:

Data cleaning; I used EXCEL to clean and standardize the raw data ensuring data accuracy and consistency. This included...
* Removing duplicates 
* Handling missing values using IF Function, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, and MODE statistical measures.

Data transformation; I employed Power Query to transform data into a more acceptable format for analysis. This included;
* Creating calculated columns
* Renaming columns
* Removing columns and 
* Data aggregation and grouping

Key Features;

* Total Calls Received: Displays the overall number of calls received.
* Total Calls Duration: Shows the total duration of all calls.
* Average Call Duration: Calculates the average length of each call.
* Average CSAT Score: Presents the average customer satisfaction score.
* SLA Status Met: Indicates the percentage of calls that met service level agreements.

* Percentage Response Time: Visualizes the distribution of response times within, below, and above SLAs.
* Number of Calls by Channel: The number of calls received through different channels (e.g., call center, chatbot, email, web).
